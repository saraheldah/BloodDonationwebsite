          <h1>Importance of the Blood Supply</h1>
          <br><br>
          <p>Every two seconds of every day,people around the world need blood.<br>
             It is essential for surgeries, cancer treatment,
              chronic illnesses, and <br>traumatic injuries. 
            Whether a patient receives whole blood, red cells,<br> platelets or plasma, this lifesaving 
            care starts with one person making <br>a generous donation.  </p>
          <br>
          <h5>Facts About Blood Needs</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Less than 38 percent of the population is eligible to give blood or platelets.</li>
            <li>The average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 units.</li>
            <li>A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 units of blood.</li>
            <li>Blood and platelets cannot be manufactured; they can only come from volunteer donors.</li>
            <li>The blood type most often requested by hospitals is type O.</li>
            <li>One donation can potentially save up to three lives.</li>
            <li>People diagnosed with cancer need blood, sometimes daily, during their chemotherapy treatment. </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <h5>Blood Supply Statistics</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>About 118.4 million blood donations are collected worldwide. 40% of these are collected in high-income countries,
                    <br> home to 16 % of the world’s population.</li>
            <li>62 countries report collecting fewer than 10 donations per 1000 people. Of these, 34 countries are in the WHO 
                    <br>African Region,  four in the WHO Region of the Americas, six in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, 
                    <br> three in the WHO European Region, six in the WHO South-Eastern Asia Region, and nine in the WHO 
                    <br>Western Pacific Region. All are low- or middle-income countries.</li>
          </ol>

        <!--<h5>Blood donors</h5>
          <h6>Age and gender of blood donors</h6>
          <ol>
          <li>Data about the gender profile of blood donors show that globally 33% of blood donations are given by women,
             <br> although this ranges widely. In 14 of the 111 reporting countries, less than 10% of donations are given 
             by <br>female donors.</li>
          <li>The age profile of blood donors shows that, proportionally, more young people donate blood in low- and 
           <br>middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Demographic information of blood donors 
           is<br> important for formulating and monitoring recruitment strategies.</li>
